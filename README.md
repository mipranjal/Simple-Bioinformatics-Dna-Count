This app counts the nucleotide composition of the DNA sequence.

## Libraries
* pandas: data manipulation and analysis library
* streamlit: open-source app framework for building web applications
* altair: declarative visualization library for creating interactive visualizations
## Input

## Output
* A dictionary containing count of each nucleotide (A, T, G, C).
* Text output displaying the count of each nucleotide.
* A Pandas DataFrame displaying the count of each nucleotide.
* A bar chart displaying the count of each nucleotide using Altair.
## How to Use
* Paste or type the DNA sequence in the input box.
* The app will show the count of each nucleotide along with a bar chart visualizing the nucleotide count.
## Example
The app comes with an example DNA sequence in the input box. You can replace this example sequence with your own sequence.

## Code
